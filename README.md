Created by <a href="https://github.com/KKeshav1101">KKeshav1101</a> in December 2024 for SALVO- The AI Club of SASTRA as the club lead.<br>
The project was taken up as a challenge to handle 30+ members in a club systematically<br>
putting to use my fullstack and data visualisating+data handling skills
